Probabilistic Tipping Competition Application
=============================================

Users will be able to register accounts.

Users, acting as competition Managers will be able to create a tipping Competition.

A Competition will have a name, a type, and other optional parameters.

Users, acting as Tippers, can sign up for a Competition.

1) The Manager creates a Round for the Competition, which may be made up of one or more Matches and is run till a specified time.

A Match is made up of 2 teams (or players).

2) Tippers can create a Tip for a Match, which is a probabilistic estimate (between 0.01 and 0.99) of which team will win.

3) After the Round has finished, the Manager goes through all the Matches in a Round and marks who won (or if it was a draw)

4) After this, Tippers can see how well they are doing in the overall Competition, and how well they did in each finished Round.

5) Steps 1-4 repeat until the Manager marks the Competition as complete. Tippers can then see who won the Competition.
